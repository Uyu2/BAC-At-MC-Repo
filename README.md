# BAC-At-MC-Repo
This is a repo to encapsulate the work I did for the 2024 Business Analytics Competition at Manhattan College.

My team won Best Poster award, and was a finalist into the last phase of the competition. Our methodology included a ridge and lasso model to find predicitve coefficients, analytics on quality and overall rating, ranking of states by different metrics, and calculating ROI for each care facility.

The dataset spanned multi-state elderly care facilities, and our team aimed to identify the best state for private investment.
